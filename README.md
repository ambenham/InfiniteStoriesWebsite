### About the company
Infinite Stories is a mock inclusive bookstore committed to uplifting minorities’ voices, who believes representation, accessibility, and inclusivity are important, and all go hand in hand. This bookstore only sells books written by minorities or books about minorities, to make sure minorities’ voices and stories are heard. These minorities include but are not limited to women, people of colour, the LGBTQ+ community, the disability community, plus-size people, and refugees. In an effort to be as accessible as possible, they sell a variety of book formats, including eBooks, audiobooks, dyslexia friendly books, and books in braille.
